## Development

How to contribute to the development of the FMI standard

## Organization

The FMI specification is now managed and developed as a Modelica Association Project (MAP) according to the Modelica Association Bylaws.

## License of Project Results

The FMI specifications are published under the CC-BY-SA (Creative Common Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International) license. For details please have a look at the respective standard document.

## FMI Trademark

FMI is a registered trademark. The rules for trademark usage are here.

## Membership

Membership in this project is open to companies, institutes, universities and other organizations, which agree to support the purpose of this project and follow the project rules. There is no individual membership for this project. Project members are divided into two groups that have different rights.

## Steering Committee

The steering committee defines FMI policy, strategy, feature roadmap, and future FMI releases. Members are organizations that actively support FMI. Especially, a member has either to provide the FMI standard or part of it in a commercial or open source tool, and/or actively use FMI in industrial projects.

## Advisory Committee

The advisory committee contributes to the design of FMI. It consists of organizational members that have no voting rights but access to internal resources.

## Visitors

The FMI meetings are open to the public. Participants that are neither in the Steering or Advisory Committee are called Visitors. Visitors do not have access to the internal resources.

## Voting

Voting is performed by the Steering Committee members according to paragraph 14 of the Modelica Association Bylaws but with a quorum of four organizations. More information can be found in the FMI project Bylaws.

## Development Process

New FMI releases are developed according to the process defined in the FMI Development Process document v1.0, which was accepted by the FMI Steering Committee in April 2015. Templates for FMI change proposals are available as FCP_Template.pdf and FCP_Template.ott. Some hints and ideas about the development process can be found in the development process notes.

## Collaboration

The FMI group has a mailing list for email based discussions and holds frequent teleconferences to discuss the technical evolution of the standard. In addition, there are often FMI tracks at other FMI related events like conferences and design meetings. Development of the FMI standard is centrally managed at the FMI Trac Site. This site is used to keep track of open issues with the current specification and proposals for future versions. If you believe you could benefit from the standard or if you would like to contribute to the improvement or distribution of it, please contact us at: contact@fmi-standard.org.
